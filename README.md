# supa-skills

> Claude Code plugin marketplace for the Supatest AI team.

This repo is a [Claude Code plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces). Install skills with `/plugin install`, get updates with `/plugin update`.

## Setup (one-time per machine)

```
/plugin marketplace add supatest-ai/supa-skills
```

Then install the skills you want:

```
/plugin install commit
/plugin install work-summary
/plugin install review-pr
/plugin install test-feature
/plugin install task-to-pr
/plugin install setup-task-to-pr
/plugin install agent-browser
/plugin install automate-e2e-tests
/plugin install agent-readiness
```

Skills are installed globally and available across all your projects.

## Updating

```
/plugin update
```

This updates all installed plugins from all marketplaces at once.

Claude Code checks for updates automatically at every startup — no action needed on your end.

### Releasing updates

**Always bump `version` in `plugin.json` when you change a skill.** Claude Code compares version strings to decide whether to auto-update. If the version stays the same, installed clients will not receive the new content even after the marketplace refreshes.

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org): `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` for patches, `1.1.0` for new behaviour, `2.0.0` for breaking changes.
